\section UsdGeom_Structure Geometric Primitive Schemas

\subsection UsdGeom_Imageable UsdGeomImageable

Currently, all classes in UsdGeom inherit from UsdGeomImageable , whose intent is
to capture any prim type that might want to be rendered or visualized.  This
distinction is made for two reasons: 
- so that there \em could be types that would never want to be renderered,
and can thus be optimized around, for traversals, and also to enable
validation: for example, in a compatible shading schema, only
UsdGeomImageable-derived prims should be able to express a look/material binding.  
- for the common properties described in UsdGeomImageable, including visibility,
purpose, and the attribute schema for \ref UsdGeomPrimvar primvars.

Admittedly, not all of the classes inheriting from UsdGeomImageable really need
to be imageable - they are grouped as they are to avoid the need for
multiple-inheritance, which would arise because some classes that may not
necessarily be imageable are definitely transformable.

\subsection UsdGeom_Xformable UsdGeomXformable

In UsdGeom, all geometry prims are directly transformable.  This is
primarily a scalability and complexity management decision, since prim-count
has a strong correlation to total scene composition time and memory
footprint, and eliminating the need for a "shape" node for every piece of
geometry generally reduces overall prim count by anywhere from 30% to 50%,
depending on depth and branching factor of a scene's namespace hierarchy.

UsdGeomXformable encapsulates the schema for a prim that is transformable.
Readers familiar with AbcGeom's Xform schema will find Xformable familiar,
but more easily introspectable.  Xformable decomposes a transformation into
an ordered sequence of \ref UsdGeomXformOp "ops"; unlike AbcGeom::Xform,
which packs the op data into static and varying arrays, UsdGeomXformable
expresses each op as an independent UsdAttribute.  This data layout, while
somewhat more expensive to extract, is much more conducive to "composed scene
description" because it allows individual ops to be overridden in stronger
layers independently of all other ops.  We provide facilities leveraging
core Usd features that help mitigate the extra cost of reading more
attributes per-prim for performance-sensitive clients.

Of course, UsdGeom still requires a prim schema that simply represents a
transformable prim that scopes other child prims, which is fulfilled by
UsdGeomXform .

"basic assumptions of UsdGeom linear algebra"

\subsection UsdGeom_Gprim UsdGeomGprim

UsdGeomGprim is the base class for all "geometric primitives", which encodes
several per-primitive graphics-related properties. Defined Gprims 
currently include:
- UsdGeomMesh
- UsdGeomNurbsPatch
- UsdGeomBasisCurves
- UsdGeomNurbsCurves
- UsdGeomPoints
- UsdGeomCapsule
- UsdGeomCone
- UsdGeomCube
- UsdGeomCylinder
- UsdGeomSphere

We expect there to be some debate around the last five "intrinsic" Gprims:
Capsule, Cone, Cube, Cylinder, and Sphere, as not all DCC's support them as
primitives.  In Pixar's pipeline, we in fact rarely render these primitives,
but find them highly useful for their fast inside/outside tests in defining
volumes for lighting effects, procedural modifiers (such as "kill spheres"
for instancers), and colliders.  The last, in particular, is quite useful for
interchanging data with rigid-body simulators.  It is necessary to be able to
transmit these volumes from dressing/animation tools to
simulation/lighting/rendering tools, thus their presence in our schema.  We
expect to support these and other "non-native" schema types as some form of
proxy or "pass through" prim in DCC's that do not understand them.

\subsection UsdGeom_PointInstancer UsdGeomPointInstancer

UsdGeomPointInstancer provides a powerful, scalable encoding for scattering
many instances of multiple prototype objects (which can be arbitrary subtrees
of the UsdStage that contains the PointInstancer), animating both the
instances and prototypes, and pruning/masking instances based on integer ID.


\subsection UsdGeom_Camera UsdGeomCamera

UsdGeomCamera encodes a transformable camera.


\subsection UsdGeom_ModelAPI UsdGeomModelAPI

UsdGeomModelAPI is an API schema that extends the basic UsdModelAPI API with concepts
unique to models that contain 3D geometry.  This includes:
\li \ref UsdGeomModelAPI::GetExtentsHint "cached extent hints encompassing an entire model"
\li API for collecting and extracting all \ref UsdGeomConstraintTarget "constraint targets" for a model from the model's root prim.

\section UsdGeom_LinAlgBasics Linear Algebra in UsdGeom

To ensure reliable interchange, we stipulate the following foundational
mathematical assumptions, which are codified in the 
\ref gf_overview "Graphics Foundations (Gf) math module":
\li Matrices are laid out and indexed in row-major order, such that, given
a \c GfMatrix4d datum \em mat, \em mat[3][1] denotes the second column
of the fourth row.
\li GfVec datatypes are row vectors that <b>pre-multiply</b> matrices to 
effect transformations, which implies, for example, that it is the fourth 
row of a GfMatrix4d that specifies the translation of the transformation.
\li All rotation angles are expressed in degrees, not radians.
\li Vector cross-products and rotations intrinsically follow the
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule">right hand rule.</A>

So, for example, transforming a vector **v** by first a Scale matrix **S**,
then a Rotation matrix **R**, and finally a Translation matrix **T** can be
written as the following mathematical expression:

\par
<b>vt</b> = <b>v</b> &times; <b>S</b> &times; <b>R</b> &times; <b>T</b>

Because Gf exposes transformation methods on Matrices, not Vectors, to
effect this transformation in Python, one would write:
\code{py}
vt = (S * R * T).Transform(v)
\endcode

\section UsdGeom_WindingOrder Winding Order, Orientation, and Surface Normals

Deriving from the mathematical assumptions in the preceding section, UsdGeom
positions objects in a **right handed coordinate system**.  It also, by
default, applies the right hand rule to compute the "intrinsic", *surface
normal* (also sometimes referred to as the *geometric normal*) for all
non-implicit surface and solid types.  That is, the normal computed from
(e.g.) a polygon's sequential vertices using the right handed winding rule
determines the "front" or "outward" facing direction, that typically, when
rendered will receive lighting calculations and shading.

Since not all modeling and animation packages agree on the right hand rule,
UsdGeomGprim introduces the \ref UsdGeomGprim::GetOrientationAttr() "orientation"
attribute to enable individual gprims to select the left hand winding rule,
instead.  So, gprims whose *orientation* is "rightHanded" (which is the 
fallback) must use the right hand rule to compute their surface normal,
while gprims whose *orientation* is "leftHanded" must use the left hand rule.

However, any given gprim's \ref
UsdGeomImageable::ComputeLocalToWorldTransform() "local-to-world transformation"
can *flip* its effective orientation, when it contains an odd
number of negative scales.  This condition can be reliably detected using the
(Jacobian) determinant of the local-to-world transform: if the determinant 
is **less than zero**, then the gprim's orientation has been flipped, and
therefore one must apply the **opposite** handedness rule when computing its
surface normals (or just flip the computed normals) for the purposes of
hidden surface detection and lighting calculations.


\section UsdGeom_VelocityInterpolation Applying Timesampled Velocities to Geometry

UsdGeomPointBased primitives and UsdGeomPointInstancer primitives all allow
the specification of \ref UsdGeomPointBased::GetVelocitiesAttr() "velocities"
to describe point (or instance) motion at off-sample UsdTimeCode s, as an
alternative to relying on native UsdStage linear sample interpolation.  
Using velocities is the **only reliable way** of encoding the motion of 
primitives whose topology is varying over time, as adjacent samples' indices
may be unrelated to each other, and the samples themselves may not even 
possesss the same number of elements.

To help ensure that all consumers of UsdGeom data will compute identical posing
from the same dataset, we describe how the position and velocity data should be
sampled and combined to produce "interpolated" positions.  There are two
cases to consider, for both of which, we stipulate the following logic:

\li If no *velocities* are authored, then we fall back to the "standard" 
position computation logic: if the timeSamples bracketing a requested sample 
have the same number of elements, apply linear interpolation between the two 
samples; otherwise, use the value of the sample with the lower/earlier ordinate.

\li If *velocities* are authored at a higher frequency than *points* (or 
\em positions, in the case of UsdGeomPointInstancer), fall back to standard
position computation logic.  We are effectively considering this a silent error
condition, because we do not, at this time, want to require integration to 
compute positions.

\li Otherwise, if the bracketing timeSamples for *velocities* from the
requested timeSample have the *same ordinates* as those for *points* then **use
the lower *velocities* timeSample and the lower *points* timeSample** for the
computations described below. 

<b>In summary,</b> we stipulate that the timeSampling of the *points* and
<em>velocities</em> attributes be compatible.  We do not allow velocities
to be recorded at times at which there is not a corresponding *points*
sample.  This is to simplify and expedite the calculations required to
compute a position at any requested time.  Since most simulators produce both
a position and velocity at each timeStep, we do not believe this restriction
should impose an undue burden.

\subsection UsdGeom_VelocityAtOneSample Computing a Single Requested Position

If one requires a pose at only a single point in time, *sampleTime*, such as
when stepping through "sub-frames" in an application like *usdview*, then we
need simply apply the above rules, and if we successfully sample both *points* 
and *velocities*, let:

\par
<em>t<sub>points</sub></em> = the lower bracketing time sample for the 
evaluated *points* attribute

\par 
<em>timeScale</em> = 1.0 / <tt>stage->GetTimeCodesPerSecond()</tt>

... then

\par
<em> <b>pointsInterpolated</b> =  <b>points</b> + (sampleTime - t<sub>points</sub>) * timeScale * <b>velocities</b></em> 


\subsection UsdGeom_VelocityAtMultipleSamples Computing a Range of Requested Positions

Computer graphics renderers typically simulate the effect of non-zero camera
shutter intervals (which introduces <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_blur">motion blur</a> into an
image) by sampling moving geometry at multiple, nearby sample times, for each
rendered image, linearly blending the results of each sample.  Most, if not
all renderers introduce the simplifying assumption that for any given image
we wish to render, we will not allow the topology of geometry to change over
the time-range we sample for motion blur.

Therefore, if we are sampling a topologically varying,
*velocities*-possessing UsdGeomMesh at sample times <em>t<sub>1</sub></em>,
<em>t<sub>2</sub></em> ...  <em>t<sub>n</sub></em> in order to render the
mesh with motion blur, we stipulate that all *n* samples be computed from
<b>the same sampled points and velocities values sampled at
<em>sampleTime</em></b>.  Therefore, we would compute all *n* samples using
the above formula, but iterating over the *n* samples, substituting
<em>t<sub>i</sub></em> for *sampleTime*.

Two things to note:

\li Since we are applying strictly linear interpolation, why is it useful to 
compute more than two samples?  For UsdGeomPointBased primitives, the 
object-space samples will not require more than two samples, although 
local-to-world transformations may introduce non-linear motion.  For 
UsdGeomPointInstancer primitives, which also possess an *angularVelocities*
attribute for the instances, it may often be desirable to sample the 
instance matrices (and therefore *positions*) at a higher frequency since
angular motion is non-linear.
\li If the range of <em>t<sub>1</sub></em> to <em>t<sub>n</sub></em> is greater
than the recorded sampling frequency of *points*, then computing the
"singular" value of *points* at some time <em>t<sub>other</sub></em> that is
within the range <em>t<sub>1</sub></em> to <em>t<sub>n</sub></em> may 
produce a different value (with differing number of elements) than the computed
value for the same time using the motion blur technique.  This derives from our
requirement that over the given motion range, the topology must not change, so
we specifically ignore any other *points* or *velocities* samples that occur in
the requested motion range.


\section UsdGeom_StageMetrics Stage Metrics

The classes described above are concerned with individual primitives and 
properties.  Some geometic quantities, however, describe aspects of an entire
scene, which we encode as /stage metadata/.  For example it is UsdGeom that
allows \ref UsdGeomUpAxis_group .
